# KnippaCab Development Plan

## Design Philosophy: Progressive Complexity

**Core Principle:** Start users with "one-click" simplicity, reveal advanced controls as they gain confidence.

Like a video game tutorial: early levels give you one button to press, later levels unlock full control schemes. We want DIYers to succeed on their first cabinet, then discover they can customize everything as they learn.

**Project Scope Evolution:** From single cabinet calculator → full kitchen design system → AR-powered visualization tool.

---

## UX Strategy: Three Tiers of Complexity

### Tier 1: "Quick Start" Mode (80% of users)
**Goal:** Build a standard base cabinet in under 2 minutes.

**User sees:**
- Cabinet type picker with photos (Base / Wall / Tall / Corner)
- Width selector with standard sizes only (dropdown: 12", 18", 24", 30", 36")
- One button: "Calculate My Cabinet"

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Uses all defaults from `cabinetDefaults.ts`
- Standard height/depth for the cabinet type
- Default reveals (1.5mm/3mm)
- Pocket hole joinery
- Standard 4" toe kick (base cabs only)
- 3/4" plywood for box, 1/2" for back
- Auto-generates cut list with grain direction already optimized

**Output:** Instant cut list with a simple 2D cutting diagram.

---

### Tier 2: "Custom Dimensions" Mode (15% of users)
**User unlocks this by:** Tapping "Advanced Options" toggle on the Quick Start screen.

**User now sees:**
- Custom dimensions input (still in their preferred units)
- Toe kick options: Standard / Custom height / None
- Material thickness picker (presets: 1/2", 5/8", 3/4")
- Optional: Number of drawers
- **NEW:** 2D layout view to arrange multiple cabinets side-by-side

**What still uses defaults:**
- Reveals (most users don't know what this means yet)
- Joinery method (pocket holes still default)
- Grain direction (auto-assigned)

**Output:** Same as Tier 1, but with their custom measurements + visual layout of cabinet arrangement.

---

### Tier 3: "Pro Mode" (5% of users, or Tier 2 users after 3+ projects)
**User unlocks this by:** Accessing "Pro Settings" in project settings, or after saving 3 projects.

**User now sees:**
- Reveal calculator (side/top/bottom individually adjustable)
- Joinery method selector per cabinet (pocket hole / dado / butt / dowel)
- Material library (add custom plywood grades, thicknesses, costs)
- Drawer construction details (corner joinery + bottom method)
- Dado depth settings (affects cut list dimensions)
- Saw kerf adjustment
- Manual grain direction override on any part
- **NEW:** Corner cabinet angle/depth customization
- **NEW:** 3D cabinet preview (V2)
- **NEW:** AR room visualization (V2)

**Output:** Full professional-grade cut list with assembly instructions adapted to their joinery choices + 3D/AR visualization.

## Feature Flagging Strategy

Use a simple settings object to progressively unlock features:

```typescript
// src/constants/featureFlags.ts
export const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  // Phase 1
  basicCabinetCalculator: true,
  
  // Phase 2
  sheetOptimizer: true,
  
  // Phase 3
  customDimensions: true,
  metricUnits: true,
  drawerSupport: true,
  
  // Phase 4
  multiCabinetProjects: true,
  layout2D: true,  // NEW
  projectSaveLoad: true,
  
  // Phase 4.5
  cornerCabinets: true,  // NEW
  
  // Phase 5 - Pro Mode (unlock after 3 saved projects or manual toggle)
  joinerySelector: false,  // Tier 3
  revealCustomization: false,  // Tier 3
  dadoSettings: false,  // Tier 3
  materialLibrary: false,  // Tier 3
  
  // Phase 6
  doorCalculator: true,
  drawerFaceCalculator: true,
  
  // Phase 7
  pdfExport: true,
  costEstimation: true,
  
  // V2 Features
  visualization3D: false,  // Phase 8
  augmentedReality: false,  // Phase 9
};
```

**Why this works:**
- Early users don't see incomplete features
- Advanced users can opt-in via settings
- We can ship incomplete builds for testing
- Easy to AB test feature complexity
- V2 features can be beta-tested with subset of users

## Open Questions & Future Considerations

### Questions We'll Answer During Development:
1. **Sheet size flexibility:** Should we let Tier 2 users pick sheet size, or keep 4x8 default until Tier 3?
2. **Material library scope:** Start with 3 preset materials, or let Tier 1 users add custom from the start?
3. **Drawer quantity:** Auto-suggest drawer count based on cabinet height, or require manual input?
4. **Reveal presets:** Offer "tight" vs "standard" vs "loose" reveal presets before full customization?
5. **Hardware integration:** Link to actual products (affiliate?) or just give specs?
6. **2D layout grid:** Snap to 1" increments, or allow free placement?
7. **Corner cabinet defaults:** Start with 36" diagonal only, or offer 42" option in Tier 1?
8. **3D performance:** Minimum device specs for smooth 3D rendering?
9. **AR accuracy:** How to handle rooms with poor lighting or dark walls?

### Variables We Might Be Missing:
- **Edge banding:** Do we calculate edge banding length/quantity? (Probably Phase 6+)
- **Back panel options:** Hardboard vs plywood vs shiplap? (Tier 3)
- **Shelf quantity/adjustability:** Fixed shelves vs adjustable holes? (Phase 4)
- ~~**Corner cabinet support:** Lazy Susan mechanics? (V2 - complex geometry)~~ ← NOW PHASE 4.5
- **Overlay types:** Full overlay vs inset vs partial? (Phase 6, Tier 3)
- **Hinge types:** European cup vs butt hinges? (Phase 6)
- **Finish allowances:** Does paint/stain thickness affect reveals? (Tier 3, edge case)
- **Multi-sheet optimization:** What if parts don't fit on one sheet? (Phase 2 stretch goal)
- **2D layout wall dimensions:** How to input room boundaries/obstacles?
- **Cabinet spacing:** Auto-calculate fillers between non-standard gaps?
- **Appliance integration:** Show fridge/stove/dishwasher in 2D/3D layout?
- **Countertop overhang:** Does 2D layout show countertop edges?
- **3D export formats:** OBJ, STL, or both for external CAD tools?
- **AR room persistence:** Save AR placements between sessions?
- **Multi-user collaboration:** Share projects for family/contractor input?

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

**Completed:**
- ✅ Project scaffolding (Expo + dependencies)
- ✅ Folder structure
- ✅ Unit conversion utility (src/utils/unitConversion.ts)
- ✅ TypeScript types (src/types/index.ts)
- ✅ Cabinet constants (src/constants/cabinetDefaults.ts)
- ✅ Navigation setup + placeholder screens

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Minimal Viable Cabinet

**Next Task:** Cabinet calculator module (src/utils/cabinetCalculator.ts)

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:** Foundation is solid. Expanded plan now covers full kitchen design workflow (multi-cabinet projects, corner solutions, 2D layout) and V2 vision (3D visualization, AR preview). Ready to build first tangible feature (cabinet calculation logic).

## Notes for Ryan

**Remember:**
- Don't build Tier 3 features in Phase 1 — resist the temptation!
- Test on real DIYers (not just yourself) to validate Tier 1 simplicity
- If you're confused by a term, your users will be too → simplify or hide in Tier 3
- Every new input field is cognitive load → default it until proven necessary
- **NEW:** Multi-cabinet projects are core to V1, not an afterthought — design single-cabinet features with multi-cabinet scaling in mind
- **NEW:** Corner cabinets are complex but essential — don't skip them, but keep Tier 1 simple (diagonal only)
- **NEW:** 2D layout is a differentiator — invest in polish here, it's what users will share on social media
- **NEW:** 3D/AR are V2 — don't let them distract from shipping V1, but keep them in mind architecturally

**When in doubt:**
- Start with the simplest version that works
- Ship it
- Learn what users actually need
- Add granularity based on real feedback

**Philosophy:**
> "A beginner should be able to design their first cabinet without knowing what a 'reveal' is. An expert should be able to specify reveals down to the millimeter. Both should feel the app was built for them."

**Extended Philosophy (Multi-Cabinet & Visualization):**
> "A DIYer should be able to layout their whole kitchen in 2D, see it in 3D, preview it in AR in their actual space, get a complete cut list and shopping list, and build it confidently — all from their phone while standing in their kitchen."
